book_info is a table that describe the many to many relationship between book and author- there one book can be written by many author, an anthor also can write many    book.
--note:
@many-to-many use to link the table, there should be define one as owner and one should be inverse side(which will be mapped by owner)
!@jsonIgnore is a must
@many-to-one in book_info refer that we can use bookInfoRepository to get the data from both side, since I want to have a access to read the whole table, @jsonignore did not add in book_info
